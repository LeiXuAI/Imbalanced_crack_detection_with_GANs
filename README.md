# This repositories is a CVDI project about anomaly detection on road surfaces with GANs.
Usually anomalous parts only occupy a minor proportion of a road surface image, hence it is difficult to tackle such tasks using general networks. The Generative Adversarial Networks architecture has achieved prosporous outcomings on tackling various tasks on imbalanced datasets. 
Code will be released when the paper is released in the next several months.
