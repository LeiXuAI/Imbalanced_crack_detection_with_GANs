# This repositories is a CVDI project about anomaly detection on road surfaces with GANs.
The anomalous parts only occupy a minor proportion of a road surface image. The Generative Adversarial Networks architecture has achieved prosporous outcomings on tackling various imbalance tasks. 
Code will be released when the paper is released in the next several months.
